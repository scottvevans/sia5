# sia5 - Spring in Action, 5th Edition

Repository for my code as I work through the book [Spring in Action, 5th Edition](https://www.manning.com/books/spring-in-action-fifth-edition?query=spring%20in%20action) by Craig Walls, October 2018. This book is good conceptually, but is full of errors and omissions in the code. 
I'm correcting them as I go along as a learning exercise. Enjoy.
